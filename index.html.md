    <h4>THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTMENT</h4>
    <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browserspecific
tags, incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and
abandoned browsers.
We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has
been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C,
WASP, and the major browser creators.
The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the
important lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn
to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating
fashion. Become one with the web.</p>

    <h4>SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</h4>
    <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browserspecific
tags, incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support, and
abandoned browsers.
We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has
been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C,
WASP, and the major browser creators.
The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the
important lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn

    <h4>PARTICIPATION</h4>
    <p>Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are
modifying this page, so strong CSS skills are necessary too, but
the example files are commented well enough that even CSS
novices can use them as starting points. Please see the CSS
Resource Guide for advanced tutorials and tips on working with
CSS.
You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the
HTML. This may seem daunting at first if you’ve never worked
this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use
the sample files as a guide.
Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy locally.
Once you have completed your masterpiece (and please, don’t
submit half-finished work) upload your CSS file to a web server
under your control. Send us a link to an archive of that file
and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will
download it and place it on our server.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="contenedor-4">
    <h4> BENEFITS</h4>
    <p>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we
can all refer to showing people how amazing CSS really can be.
This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those working on
the web today, learning tool for those who will be tomorrow,
and gallery of future techniques we can all look forward to.</p>
  </div>
  
    <div class="contenedor-5">
    <h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4>
    <p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage.
CSS 3 & 4 should be limited to widely-supported elements only,
or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden
is about functional, practical CSS and not the latest bleedingedge
tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real
requirement we have is that your CSS validates.
Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers
have implemented CSS by now. When sticking to the guidelines
you should see fairly consistent results across most modern
browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web
these days — especially when you factor in mobile — pixelperfect
layouts may not be possible across every platform. That’s
okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should
work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and
Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).
We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect
copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material to a
minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual
themes to your work. We’re well past the point of needing
another garden-related design.
This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain
full copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see
submission guidelines), but we ask you release your CSS under
a Creative Commons license identical to the one on this site so
that others may learn from your work.
